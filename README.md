# Intra WebShare

It is a web-based file-sharing application designed for seamless and efficient file transfer within an internal network (intranet).

## Features

- **Ease of Use**: No login credentials required, just access the application and start sharing.
- **Multi-File Support**: Automatically converts selected multiple files into a zip file before sending.
- **IP Address-Based Connectivity**: Uses IP addresses for secure intranet connections.
- **Web-Based Interface**: Simple and user-friendly, accessible via web browsers.

## How It Works

- **Initial Connection**: Sender and receiver access Intra-WebShare through their web browsers.
- First sender selects the files and clicks on send which then keeping sender files in sender buffer and displays the sender's IP on screen. 
- Receiver has to enter sender's IP which then intiates a connection with sender and receives the file.


## Future Work

- **Decentralization**: Implementing a fully decentralized P2P file transfer system to further enhance security and efficiency.
- **Authentication**: As of know there is no authenticity of the receiver which we will implement with a pin.
